// Ask the user for a series of numbers, and append each one to a list. Stop when they enter 0. 
// (Remember: You should not add 0 to the list. If you do, later calculations and operations will not be correct.)

// Once you have a list, have your program do the following:

// Core Requirements
    // 1.  Compute the sum, or total, of the numbers in the list.
    // 2.  Compute the average of the numbers in the list.
    // 3.  Find the maximum, or largest, number in the list.
    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    
    // Create an EMPTY list to store the numbers.
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
        // this is same as saying numbers = [] in python when you want to create an empty list

    // Also, it needs to be equal to something other than 0, so the loop will Run at least once.

    // Now, use a while loop to keep asking for numbers until the user enters 0.
        while (number != 0)
        {
            // Ask the user for a number.
            Console.Write("Enter a number: ");

            // number = int.Parse(input); // This is the same as saying number = int(input) in python

            }
       }
    // Print the list of numbers to the console so we can see what we entered.
    // Console.WriteLine(numbers); // This will not work, because it will not print the list in a readable format.
    // Instead, we can use string.Join to convert the list to a string and print it.

// Stretch Challenge
    // 1.  Have the user enter both positive and negative numbers, 
    // then find the smallest positive number (the positive number that is closest to zero).

    // 2.  Sort the numbers in the list and display the new, sorted list. 
    // Hint: There are C# libraries that can help you here, try searching the internet for them.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------


    // I think I need a foreach loop to iterate through the list of numbers and find the smallest positive number.
    // I will also need a variable to store the smallest positive number.

        // Another way to do this is to use LINQ to find the smalles positive number.
        // We can use the WHERE method to filter the list and then use the MIN method to find the smallest number.
    
        // LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.
        // It's a feature in C# that lets you query collections like lists (and databases, arrays, etc.) in a clean,

        // INCLUDE this line at the top of your code to use LINQ:
        // using System.Linq

        // .Where() is a LINQ method that filters a list and CREATES a new list that only contains items that match a condition you give it.
        // Using the numbers list from above, we can filter it to only include positive numbers.
        // My list might look like this: 
        // List<int> numbers = new List<int> {5, 6, -3, 7, -2};
        // Use .Where() to filter the list to only include positive numbers and reate a new list called positiveNumbers.
        List<int> positiveNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n > 0).ToList(); 
        // This is the same as saying positiveNumbers = [n for n in numbers if n > 0] in python
        // numbers is the original list
        // .Where(n => n > 0) means "Go through each number n in the list and keep it only if it's greater than 0."
        // .ToList() converts the result back into a normal list you can use.

        // print the positiveNumbers list to the console so we know it worked.
        Console.WriteLine("The positive numbers are: ");
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", positiveNumbers)); 

        // Before we can find the smallest positive number, we need to check if the list is empty.
        // If it is empty, we can't find the smallest positive number.
        // If it is not empty, we can use the .Min() method to find the smallest positive number.
        // .Min() is a LINQ method that finds the smallest number in a list.
        if (positiveNumbers.Count > 0)
        // .Count is a property that tells us how many items are in the list.
        // it is the same as saying len(positiveNumbers) in python
        {
            int smallestPositiveNumber = positiveNumbers.Min();
